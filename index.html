            <h3 id="about"> About Me </h3> 
            <p> After graduating university, I put my mechanical engineering to the side and moved to Europe to play 6 seasons of professional volleyball. My career has allowed me to be fully immersed in Austrian, Swiss, and Spanish cultures and the experience has been life changing. Because I always want to grow, I started searching for what my next chapter will be. Through taking free online courses, I discovered I have a passion for software development. I decided to follow that passion and become a student at Thinkful. Now, I am on a new journey towards a new career. Luckily, the attributes I have as an athlete (driven, competitive, and a good teammate) are also advantages to me as a developer.     </p>
